\chapter{INTRODUCTION}

Introduce the thing, which is about values [@schwartz_overview_2012].

```{r fig.width=5, fig.height=5, fig.cap='This is a fun caption'}
hist(rnorm(1e3))
```

It can also be helpful to separate your chapters out into separate Rmd files, as [demonstrated by Tyson Barrett](http://tysonbarrett.com/jekyll/update/2018/02/11/r_dissertation/). That would look something like adding the following R chunk:

````r
`r ''````{r child = "introduction.Rmd"}
```
````
